## Options

Adding variant options to your product is **very important**. Variant info is what the collection pages use to create product filters.

### Start by adding the size option

!> Size must always be the first option you create

Create the option. Call it `Size` (with a capital).

Add all the options there are for that product. Sizes should either be in acronyms (`XS`, `S`, `M`, `L`, `XL` etc.) or numbers.

?> For products that only have one size, **you must still add a product size**. It **must** be called `One Size` rather than "O/S", "OS" or anything else.
