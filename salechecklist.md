# Sale checklist

## First steps
1.	Check the Sale Preparation List on the shared drive for any updated info. 
2.	Confirm with Emma the product lists for the private and public sales.

## Adding products to collections
3.1. To add new items to a collection, search for the product using the product's SKU code and then click done. This will add the product to a dedicated collection.

3.2. Please make sure that each item from Emma’s list is added to the collection. This process is manual unfortunately.

3.3. Product collections are pre-made so please only add a product to an existing collection. You can and should add to multiple collections where appropriate. If you are in any doubt over whether a product should be added to a sale collection, please confirm with your line manager or head of the department. 
 
3.4. Each product from the sale products list should be added to dedicated collections. For example the Ecru & Navy Stripe T-Shirt would go in all of: 
* All Sale
* Sales Shirts, Polos & T-shirts 
* Private Sale

## Futher reductions: 
We might add additional discounts to items. We have set up the website to automatically show a label saying "Extra 20% off" if a product is added to [this collection](https://sirplus.myshopify.com/admin/collections/264768061488).

You will need to adjust price of the product as well using the compare at price to show the discount. If you need to adjust this at all, speak to Michal.

4.3. Bulk adjustment. 
This process will require uploading a CSV file with newly marked down prices. Please consult with Emma before moving forward.  

## Merchandising

5.2. Type sale in the search menu and click the Search button on the right. You’ll be presented with the list of all sales collections. Chose the one you’re interested in and press Sort (with Variants). You have a few options here to play around with the layout and amount of items that are displayed.
