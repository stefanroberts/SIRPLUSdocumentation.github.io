Please confirm with your line manager or head of the department. 

    Private Sale –Offering our customers first access to sale with 30% off across a range of our current sales collection exclusively. We have a dedicated collection named: Private Sale. 
    Please make sure that each item from Emma’s list is added to the collection. This process is manual. 
 

    To add new items click search products and copy the SKU code then click done. This will add the product to a dedicated collection. 
 
    Each product from the MD sales list should be added to dedicated collections. For example Ecru & Navy Stripe T-Shirt: 
•	All Sale
•	Sales Shirts, Polos & T-shirts
